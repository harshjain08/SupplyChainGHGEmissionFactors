## Introduction

This project focuses on analyzing the Supply Chain GHG Emission Factors dataset. The analysis includes exploring the distribution of emission factors across various industries, identifying trends, and providing insightful visualizations to better understand the environmental impact of different sectors.

## Dataset

- *File*: SupplyChainGHGEmissionFactors_v1.2_NAICS_CO2e_USD2021.csv
- *Description*: This dataset contains information about greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions for various industries, measured in kg CO2e/2021 USD purchaser price. It includes emission factors with and without margins, margins of emission factors, and industry codes and descriptions.

## Installation

1. Clone the repository:

    ```sh
    git clone https://github.com/harshjain08/SupplyChainGHGEmissionFactors
    ```

2. Change into the project directory:

    ```sh
    cd SupplyChainGHGEmissionFactors
    ```

3. Install the required dependencies:

    ```sh
    pip install -r requirements.txt
    ```

## Usage

1. *Upload the Notebook*:
    - Open Google Colab and upload the `Data_Analytics_Project.ipynb` notebook.

2. *Run the Notebook*:
    - Run the cells in the notebook to perform the data analysis.
    - You will be prompted to upload the `SupplyChainGHGEmissionFactors_v1.2_NAICS_CO2e_USD2021.csv` file during the notebook execution.

## Analysis and Visualizations

The analysis includes:

- *Distribution of Supply Chain Emission Factors with Margins*: Histogram to show the distribution of emission factors.
- *Correlation Matrix*: Heatmap to show the correlation between numerical features.
- *Top 10 Industries by Emission Factors*: Bar plot to show the industries with the highest emission factors.
- *Box Plot of Emission Factors*: Box plot to identify outliers in emission factors.
- *Pair Plot of Numerical Features*: Pair plot to observe relationships between numerical features.
- *Distribution of Margins of Supply Chain Emission Factors*: Histogram to show the distribution of margins.
